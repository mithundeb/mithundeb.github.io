## Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM)
The [Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM)](https://icom.pnnl.gov/TheICoMTeam) is a multi-institutional project led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and funded by the DOE Office of Science where our focus is to integrate multiple higher-resolution oceanic and atmospheric models to better project the impact of extreme flooding events in the future climate. To know more about this project and the recent publications and presentations, you can visit this [page](/ICoM/).
