## Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM)
The [Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM)](https://icom.pnnl.gov/) is a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary project led by PNNL and funded by the DOE Office of Science, where the long-term vision is to "deliver a robust predictive understanding of coastal evolution that accounts for the complex, multi-scale interactions among physical, environmental, and human systems". Our group's responsibility is to integrate multiple higher-resolution oceanic and atmospheric models to estimate better the impact of extreme flooding events in the future climate. To know more about this project and our recent publications and presentations, you can visit this [page](/project_info/ICoM/).
