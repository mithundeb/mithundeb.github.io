## Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM)
The [Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM)](https://icom.pnnl.gov/) is a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary project led by PNNL and funded by the DOE Office of Science. It has a long-term vision to <i>"deliver a robust predictive understanding of coastal evolution that accounts for the complex, multi-scale interactions among physical, environmental, and human systems"</i>. In this project, our group's responsibility is to integrate multiple higher-resolution oceanic and atmospheric models to estimate better the impact of extreme flooding events in the future climate.

This following animation shows an example of the integrated model result: maximum water surface elevation (in meters, NAVD88) in the Delaware Bay during Hurricane Irene (2011)
