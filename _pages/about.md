I am Mithun Deb, a Postdoctoral Research Associate, currently working at the Marine and Coastal Research Laboratory under the Coastal Sciences Division of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. In my PostDoc projects, I am actively working on the numerical modeling of estuarine processes (e.g., tidal hydrodynamics, turbulence, and wake effects) to aid the marine renewable energy resource assessment and evaluate the impact of climate change on hurricane-induced flooding in the U.S. and around the world.

My work and research
======
I am passionate about estuarine hydro-environmental problems and natural hazards, and motivated to contribute to the field of coastal engineering. My areas of expertise are mainly numerical modeling of hydrodynamics and waves, and field works that can help to mitigate coastal vulnerability, erosion and property loss. 

I joined the PNNL coastal ocean modeling team in August 2020 to conduct a modeling assessment of marine renewable energy in U.S. water. We are also simulating the changes in estuarine tidal processes induced by tidal energy extraction in large open water bodies like the Salish Sea, WA, and the Western Passage, ME. This tidal energy resource modeling project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Water Power Technologies Office. At the same time, I am also actively working on a multi-institutional project called Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM), led by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and funded by the DOE Office of Science. In this ICoM project, our coastal modeling team's responsibility is to integrate multiple higher-resolution oceanic and atmospheric models to better project the impact of extreme flooding events in the future climate.
