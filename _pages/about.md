I am Mithun Deb, PhD student and Graduate research assistant working at the Center for Applied Coastal Research, University of Delaware. I am interested in coastal engineering and modeling works, and currently involved in multiple government and state agency funded coastal hazard related projects in the State of Delaware.

My work and research
======
I am passionate about estuarine hydro-environmental problems and natural hazards, and motivated to contribute to the field of coastal engineering. My areas of expertise are mainly numerical modeling of hydrodynamics and waves, and field works that can help to mitigate coastal vulnerability, erosion and property loss.

Research Interests: Coastal Engineering, numerical modeling, marine renewable energy, estuarine hydrodynamics, wetlands, hurricane surge and waves, flood risk management, remote sensing & GIS.
