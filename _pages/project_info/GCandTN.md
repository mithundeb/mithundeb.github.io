Extreme water levels resulting from a combination of storm-tide flooding and riverine flooding, also known as compound flooding (CF), are among the most critical hazards to coastal communities.   

Key summaries from the ongoing work:

Ultimately, the study will highlight the importance of process-based understanding of CF via sensitivity analysis, which can aid local planning and adaptation under a changing climate.
