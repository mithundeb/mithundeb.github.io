Extreme water levels resulting from a combination of storm-tide flooding and riverine flooding, also known as compound flooding (CF), are among the most critical hazards to coastal communities. Most notably, the estuarine and deltaic regions worldwide are at higher risk than others, where the flood characteristics change based on the storm tide and river flow interaction. In low-lying regions, CF caused by the co-occurrence of extreme precipitation, river flooding, storm surge, and extreme sea level rise, are expected to increase under future climate change. Now, this complex interaction between non-linear processes depends on several key environmental variables: the estuary and river geometry, storm surge, and river discharge. Resolving these essential processes in high-fidelity models is necessary for accurate prediction and a better understanding of compound floods. Consequently, understanding how the sensitivity of CF may respond to a changing climate through joint considerations of SLR and tropical cyclone environment (e.g., atmospheric moisture, rainfall, storm intensity, etc.) is essential for flood mitigation and risk reduction, especially in converging estuaries.

1. In this study, we implemented one-way coupling of a physics-based hydrologic model DHSVM with the 3D ocean model FVCOM to evaluate the importance of higher resolution representation of the storm properties and high spatial details of the river and creek discharge to capture the compound flood characteristics.

2. This study uses the Risk Analysis Framework for Tropical Cyclones (RAFT) to construct a series of synthetic storms with perturbed SLR and environmental conditions of a Hurricane Irene-like event using  reanalysis data and climate model output.

3. we used RAFT generated synthetic storms characterized by varying storm conditions to drive process-based terrestrial-coastal models (DHSVM-FVCOM) to assess how the projected storm conditions and SLR interact with the hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in their control of CF characteristics in the Delaware Bay.

Ultimately, the study will highlight the importance of process-based understanding of CF via sensitivity analysis which can aid the local level planning and adaptation under a changing climate.
